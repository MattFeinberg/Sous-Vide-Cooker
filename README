For my final project in my introductor engineering course, Engineering in the 
Kitchen, I was tasked with modifying, trasnforming, or creating a kitchen 
appliance. I chose to convert a basic old crock pot that had been in my basement
for a long time into a sous vide cooker. I used an ESP32 microcontroller with
MicroPython and a temperature sensor. I used capacitive touch sensors to take
input from a user and used an OLED display to display temperature, time remaining
etc. This repo contains code files, graphs/analysis of the system, and a video
demonstration of my sous vide cooker in use.
